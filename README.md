Assetter is a simple Mac app that displays asset info in a window. Features include the following:

* On first launch, Assetter prompts you for the computer’s asset tag if it has not yet been set.
* The asset tag is stored in the computer’s NVRAM so it is not lost when the disk is replaced or re-imaged.
* Assetter displays the following information:
 * hostname
 * model
 * serial number
 * asset tag
 * memory
 * size and number of drives
 * ip address and hardware address of network interfaces
* The data displayed can be exported to a text file on the desktop with the push of a button.
